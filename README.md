# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing task using SQL. 
The primary objective was to transform a raw dataset into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis. 
Key steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing data formats, and addressing inconsistencies. 
By applying various SQL techniques, the project ensured data integrity and accuracy, laying a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and visualization efforts.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

## Steps Involved

### 1. Handling Missing Values

- Identified and handled missing values using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
- Ensured that the dataset has no gaps in critical fields.

### 2. Removing Duplicates

- Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data uniqueness and accuracy.

### 3. Normalizing Data Formats

- Standardized data formats for consistency, including dates, numerical values, and text fields.
- Ensured uniformity across the dataset for easier analysis.

### 4. Addressing Inconsistencies

- Identified and corrected inconsistencies in the data, such as incorrect entries and typos.
- Applied validation rules to ensure data integrity.
